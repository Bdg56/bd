## 👋 About Me

Hey there! I’m **Hardik Sharma**, a passionate **Computer Science undergraduate** at Graphic Era Hill University, Bhimtal, deeply driven by the desire to solve real-life problems using the power of **technology, data, and creative thinking**.

I have a strong foundation in **Data Structures & Algorithms**, coupled with hands-on experience in **Python**, **C/C++**, **JavaScript**, and emerging technologies like **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **Power BI**. My curiosity has led me into exciting areas such as **machine learning**, **web development**, **gesture control systems**, and **deadlock management simulations**.

> 💡 I'm a builder at heart—whether it's writing clean code, creating innovative apps, or visualizing data insights, I thrive in environments where I can learn fast, build collaboratively, and create impact.
